   As a 1B computer engineering student studying at the University of Waterloo, I am starting to find myself by exploring technology and seeing how human interactions have been shaped by technological advancements. Even at a young age, I have had a passion for technology or more specifically software & web development, and this passion has only grown since arriving at the UW campus. As a high school student I started programming in Java and Visual Basic as well as web development. During those four years, I have been involved in various projects by being a freelance graphic/web designer. Since, arriving at Waterloo, I have started programming in C# and C++. In my last co-op term, working at the University of Waterloo's Marketing and Strategic Communications team as a junior developer, I have gained knowledge in Node.js, Meteor, and JavaScript. During this work term, I also designed HTML responsive emails, and learned about the importance of making the web accessible to everyone.

As for a bit about my personal life, I was born in Sri Lanka and moved to Canada at the age of ten. For the past seven years before attending the University of Waterloo, I have been living in Fredericton, New Brunswick. I enjoy playing & watching sports and value the importance of community. Growing up in Sri Lanka I loved cricket, and since moving to Canada, I have expanded to other sports. I became a life-guard in my senior year of high-school. Since I was in grade seven, I have been volunteering at a nursing home; it has really impacted my outlook on life and I have had the chance to meet so many incredible people.
