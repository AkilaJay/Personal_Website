   As a 2A computer engineering student studying at the University of Waterloo, I am gaining immense amounts of knowledge by exploring new technology and improving my current skills. I worked as a full-stack developer at GatewayiQ during my last work term. This allowed me to work with the LAMP stack, and expanded my knowledge on web servers. I also got the opportunity to work with hash tables, and be a part of developing complex training software. Throughout my schooling at Waterloo, I have also been exposed to C#, Java, C++ and VHDL. This includes completing projects such as creating a navigation app, learning about various data structures, and creating a traffic light system. On my free time, I enjoy learning about technology. I have experience with AngularJS, the Ionic framework, MEAN stack. This is just a general overview of my skills and knowledge, and explore the resume and the project sections of the site to learn more about me. As for a bit about my personal life, I was born in Sri Lanka and moved to Canada at the age of ten. For the past seven years before attending the University of Waterloo, I have been living in Fredericton, New Brunswick. I enjoy playing & watching sports and value the importance of community. Growing up in Sri Lanka I loved cricket, and since moving to Canada, I have expanded to other sports. I became a life-guard in my senior year of high-school. Since I was in grade seven, I have been volunteering at a nursing home; it has really impacted my outlook on life and I have had the chance to meet so many incredible people.
